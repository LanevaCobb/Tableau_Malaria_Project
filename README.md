This project was to introduce me to analyzing data on a Tableau dashboard. There were 3 dashboards to choose from. I chose this one in particular because I remember the crisis happening in parts of Africa. I was curious to know what the data would tell me.

Here is the link to the dashboard. You would notice that it is quite simple. The message the data provided is quite profound:

I've also attached a pdf file outlining my thoughts and insights derived from this dashboard.
